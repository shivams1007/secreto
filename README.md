# Secreto: Secure Offline Password Manager

## Description
Secreto is a mobile application designed to provide a secure and convenient solution for storing sensitive information such as passwords, passkeys, and other confidential data. Unlike cloud-based password managers, Secreto operates entirely offline, ensuring that your sensitive information remains private and protected within your device's local SQLite database.

## Features
- **Offline Storage:** Secreto stores all your sensitive information locally on your device, eliminating the need to rely on cloud services or an internet connection.
- **Encryption:** Passwords and other sensitive data are encrypted before being stored in the SQLite database, ensuring that even if someone gains access to your device, they cannot access your information without the encryption key.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application features an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, allowing users to quickly add, view, and manage their passwords and other sensitive data.
- **Categories:** Organize your passwords and information into customizable categories to keep your data well-organized and easy to find.
- **Secure Backup:** Secreto allows users to create encrypted backups of their data, providing an extra layer of security and peace of mind.
- **Biometric Authentication:** Secure access to the application using biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint or face recognition, adding an extra layer of security to your sensitive information.

## How It Works

2. **Setup:** Upon first launch, set up a master password or passkey to secure access to the application.
3. **Add Information:** Start adding your passwords, passkeys, and sensitive information to the app, categorizing them as needed for easy access.
4. **Encryption:** All data entered into Secreto is encrypted using advanced encryption algorithms before being stored in the local SQLite database.
5. **Access Anytime:** Access your stored information anytime, anywhere, without the need for an internet connection.
6. **Backup:** Optionally, create encrypted backups of your data to ensure you never lose access to your sensitive information.

## Security Measures
- **Encryption:** Secreto uses industry-standard encryption algorithms to encrypt all stored data, ensuring that your information remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized users.
- **Master Password:** A master password or passkey is required to access the Secreto app, adding an extra layer of security to your sensitive information.
